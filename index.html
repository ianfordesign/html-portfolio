    <h1>Iâ€™m Ian, a product designer based in Manchester, UK.</h1>
    <h2>Transitioned from visual design to specialising in UX design. <br/>
        <br/>

        As a Virgo, a minimalist, and an introvert. I leverage these unique weapons in my career:
        I love simplifying complexity and analysing human behaviour. 
        I focus on having a clear strategy and ensuring that products enhance engagement, usability, and efficiency.
